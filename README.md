# Alice Packet Analyzer

A pedagogical tool to demonstrate the details of the HTTPS/TLS protocols in action.

Given a URL to browse, the tool can capture the transmitted encrypted packets while browsing a website, use the session key to decrypt the packets, and display the information along with the protocol details (e.g., TLS handshake, SSL certification verification) on a user interface.

## How to decrypt SSL/TLS packets manually

Using SSLKEYLOGFILE and Wireshark to decrypt TLS/SSL traffic on kali linux [(reference)](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K50557518#OnLinux):

- Set the SSLKEYLOGFILE environment variable by using the following command syntax: `export SSLKEYLOGFILE="/home/kali/<whatever path you want/key.txt>"`
- Let Wireshark know the path: Edit > Preferences > Protocols > TLS > (Pre)-Master-Secret log filename enter `"/home/kali/<whatever path you want/key.txt>"` so it will get the keys and automatically decrypt TLS/SSL traffic.
- Run a browser in the same terminal process (use curl or chromium, Kaliâ€™s firefox version does not work). When the browser accesses a HTTPS website, it will log the keys to the file path you specified as SSLKEYLOGFILE . Wireshark will use the keys in that file to decrypt traffic and on Wireshark interface you will be able to see packets translated into HTTP request and response data.

[Here is a bash script file](./backend/alice.sh) to automate the process.

## How to run our tool

Dependencies:

- flask
- tshark
- cURL

This software must be run on linux Kali (for tshark to be listening to the right channel during packet capture).

To run the web app, go to the `./frontend/` folder and run `python3 app.py 5000`. Website will be live at `localhost:5000`.

## How to use our tool

- Submit an HTTPS URL on the homepage.
- On the next page, you may take a encrypted view, decrypted view, or verbose view of the protocols and see introduction of the protocols abd detailed information about the protocol of your HTTPS connection.
  - Encrypted view: IP, TCP, TLS.
  - Decrypted view: IP, TCP, HTTP.
  - Verbose: all the protocols above.
